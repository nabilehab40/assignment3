    //            Question 1:
    //            What is the primary purpose of an interface in C#?
    //            a) To provide a way to implement multiple inheritance
    //            b) To define a blueprint for a class
    //            c) To declare abstract methods and properties
    //            d) To create instances of objects

    //            answer is b


    //            Question 2:
    //           Which of the following is NOT a valid access modifier for interface members in C#?
    //            a) private
    //            b) protected
    //           c) internal
    //            d) public


    //            answer is a


    //            Question 3:
    //          Can an interface contain fields in C#?
    //          a) Yes
    //          b) No
    //            c) Only if they are static
    //                d) Only if they are readonly
    //              answer is b

    //Question 4:
    //In C#, can an interface inherit from another interface?
    //a) No, interfaces cannot inherit from each other
    //b) Yes, interfaces can inherit from multiple interfaces
    //c) Yes, but only if they have the same methods
    //d) Only if the interfaces are in the same namespace

    //  answer is b





    //Question 5:
    //Which keyword is used to implement an interface in a class in C#?
    //a) inherit
    //b) use
    //c) extends
    //d) implements
    //          answer is d

    //Question 6:
    //Can an interface contain static methods in C#?
    //a) Yes
    //b) No
    //c) Only if the interface is sealed
    //d) Only if the methods are private
    //          answer is a

    //Question 7:
    //In C#, can an interface have explicit access modifiers for its members?
    //a) Yes, for all members
    //b) No, all members are implicitly public
    //c) Yes, but only for abstract members
    //d) Only if the interface is sealed
    //          answer is b
    //Question 8:
    //What is the purpose of an explicit interface implementation in C#?
    //a) To hide the interface members from outside access
    //b) To provide a clear separation between interface and class members
    //c) To allow multiple classes to implement the same interface
    //d) To speed up method resolution
    //          answer is a


    //Question 9:
    //In C#, can an interface have a constructor?
    //a) Yes, but it must be private
    //b) No, interfaces cannot have constructors
    //c) Yes, but only if the interface is sealed
    //d) Only if the constructor is static
    //          answer is b

    //Question 10:
    //How can a C# class implement multiple interfaces?
    //a) By using the "implements" keyword
    //b) By using the "extends" keyword
    //c) By separating interface names with commas
    //d) A class cannot implement multiple interfaces

    //  answer is c
